BinaryTreesTester
=================

CS261 HW-9 BinaryTrees Tester class and accompanying files.

The only file needed to run the Tester is "numbers.txt" the rest is for your own benefit.

BinaryTreesTester.java will output a "testOutput.txt" file which is hard copy of the data that is in the console.

"answers.txt" is a copy of what all the output should be.  This has been checked by me, Nathan Wang, and Jonathan Adams.

Feel free to distribute to anybody just remember to say thanks!
